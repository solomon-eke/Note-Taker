# Note Taker

## Description

This application allows a user to write, save, view, and delete notes. The application uses an Express.js backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
